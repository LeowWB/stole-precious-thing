Assistant Professor Wu Jie's group will leverage recent advances in organic synthesis with continued development of engineered continuous-flow reactors to provide new chemical transformations and technologies with relevance to contemporary problems. The field of flow chemistry is rapidly expanding and has the potential to revolutionize the synthesis of organic molecules. It has also been identified as a key research area for sustainable manufacturing in industry. The long-term goal is to advance otherwise difficult or ineffective chemical reactions using continuous-flow techniques, as well as to develop new chemical strategies to aid the multistep flow process.
We are seeking highly-driven, creative and ambitious postdoctoral fellows to join us in our efforts to develop sustainable chemistry using continuous flow methods. The successful candidates will be conducting research project(s) independently, with supervision from the PI, draft at least one grant, and mentor junior students in the laboratory.

Qualifications:
The RF candidates must hold an internationally recognized Ph.D. degree in organic chemistry, and should have proven track record of excellence in experimental research. Candidate with experience and knowledge in multistep synthesis or photo chemical synthesis is preferred.
