We are seeking a highly motivated candidate to join our group. Our laboratory works on the roles of noncoding RNAs in regulating reproduction using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. This project involves investigating the roles of long noncoding RNA-small RNA-mRNA regulatory relationships during oocyte ageing. The ARO will perform genetic, biochemical and molecular experiments to dissect the mechanism of oocyte ageing.
Requirements:

  BSc (Hons) / MSc in Biological Sciences or related fields
  Interested in pursuing PhD study is preferred
  Experience in RNA/protein biochemistry techniques/NGS bioinformatics analysis will be an advantage

Salary and benefits are commensurable to educational qualifications and working experience of the candidates. Benefits include annual leave, medical and flexi-benefits, etc.
