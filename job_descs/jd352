A chef de cuisine is the hands-on leader in a restaurant kitchen. From hiring and training staff to supervising food preparation and final plating, the chef de cuisine is directly responsible for every dish that comes out of the kitchen. These highly skilled chefs create and revise recipes, seek out new ingredients, delegate kitchen tasks, stay up-to-date on current food trends and techniques, and ensure their kitchens adhere to all relevant local health department codes. A professional kitchen is an intense environment, so chefs de cuisine must be able to endure long hours of standing and walking around, along with working nights and weekends.
