The School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering is looking for a Research Associate.
The Research Associate (RA) will be responsible for the development of bacterial cellulose (BC)-based materials with tunable optical properties. He/she will design and conduct experiments to modify the microstructures of BC and investigate its impact on the optical properties using various techniques (e.g. microscopy and spectroscopy). Extensive experiences in bacterial cellulose production and microscopic characterizations are a must. In addition to performing experiments, the RA will take the lead in writing of technical reports as well as assist in the writing of annual report to the funding agency.
Key Responsibilities:

  Cellulose production by bacteria
  Material characterizations
  Development of cellulose based composite materials for optical applications
  Analyze data from experiments and present research progress regularly
  Compile results in a scientific manner and contribute data for manuscripts
  Write technical reports for submission to grant agency
  Master’s degree in Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Biotechnology or related fields
  Experienced in molecular biology and bacterial culture
  Working knowledge in materials characterizations (i.e. SEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS, TGA, optical)
  Ability to design cellulose-based composite materials and experiments for characterizing the materials is a must
  Ability to work independently as well as a team player
  Track record of publication(s) is an advantage
  Excellent laboratory research, planning, data management and leadership skills
  Highly motivated and dedicated to the development of the project
