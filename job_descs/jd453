We are seeking a highly motivated research fellow with a strong algebraic background, who is interested to explore new research directions in deep learning, and more generally in Artificial Intelligence. The successful candidate can expect to conduct research on a completely new topic that combines commutative algebra with AI, and will work closely with other team members.
The goal of this project is to develop an algebraic framework for understanding the architecture hyperparameters of deep neural networks, especially in relation to unsupervised feature learning. This framework shall be based on methods from both commutative algebra and computational algebra. We shall also build upon this algebraic framework and develop algorithms for generating optimal neural network architectures that are able to perform optimized feature learning on unlabeled data sets.

  Required: PhD degree in mathematics, with experience in commutative algebra, computational algebra, homological algebra, or a related algebraic area.
  The candidate is expected to have at least some programming experience, and must be open to learning new things (e.g. in computer science).
  An ideal candidate is excited by the possibility of applying algebraic methods (e.g. in computational commutative algebra or homological algebra) to problems in Artificial Intelligence, specifically in machine learning and machine reasoning.
  Candidates with strong algebraic backgrounds are prioritized.

Interested candidates should submit a current CV and copies of academic transcripts (from both undergraduate and post-graduate studies), as well as
provide the contact details of one referee willing to provide a recommendation letter for the candidate. We regret to inform that only shortlisted candidates will be notified.
