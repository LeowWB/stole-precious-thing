MoneySmart Group is South East Asia's leading personal financial portal helping consumers compare loans, insurance and credit cards. MoneySmart was founded in 2009 with the simple aim to help consumers make better financial decisions.
With multiple banks and insurers pushing countless products out to consumers in the market today, navigating one's way through all the marketing and technical jargon while dodging the tactics of their overly pushy sales representatives simultaneously can be a major challenge, even for the experienced consumer. We are a market leader in Singapore and Indonesia and expanding fast into the region.
