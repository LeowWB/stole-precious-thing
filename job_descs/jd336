Join Affinity and be part of the future of identity: secure, portable and controlled by the individual.

Affinity empowers individuals and organisations with ownership and control of their verifiable data, to unlock value across borders and platforms.
Leveraging on the building blocks that Affinity provides, trusted institutions and entities can issue verifiable credentials to users, which can in turn be shared with other applications to access services in an open and interoperable ecosystem.

Currently undergoing development are two applications that leverage Affinity’s technology – Trident, a curated B2B marketplace and trade platform connecting verifiable, international partners for seamless cross-border trade; and Good Worker, an online job matching platform for seasonal workers and employers in India.

Affinity, along with the applications Trident and Good Worker, are seeded by Temasek, a global investment company headquartered in Singapore.
We are building a motivated and entrepreneurial team who is passionate about identity, decentralization and technology to make this happen.

This role at Affinity provides a unique opportunity for a high performing individual to have broad impact. You will work closely with a talented and diverse group of engineers, product managers and industry experts.
