Use advanced molecular computational techniques (including quantum chemical calculations, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation) to explore separation in membrane and nanoporous materials, as well as the rational design of new materials.
The candidates should have a doctorate degree in chemical engineering, chemistry or physics, strong background in molecular computations, experiences in quantum chemical calculations, Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics simulation, etc. The candidates should be highly-motivated with passion for creativity and independence. Suitably qualified applicants are invited to send in their application, including a full resume (CV), publication list, details of two academic referees.
Only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.
